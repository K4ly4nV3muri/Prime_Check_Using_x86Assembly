# Prime_Check_Using_x86Assembly
Wrote a simple Assembly programme to check if a number is whether a prime or not. :)
To compile the following code, follow the steps.

1) Install nasm(Netwide Assembler) is an assembler and disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture.
   command for installing nasm: sudo apt-get install nasm

2) Command for compiling Assembly Code: nasm -f elf file_name.asm.
3)  Then, gcc file_name.o -o file_name.
